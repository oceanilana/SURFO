These files are from my analyses as a 2024 SURFO fellow in Hongjie Wang's Ocean Carbon Lab at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography. 
The code in the Oyster_Farm.R file is used for writing monthly Oyster Farm Water Chemistry Reports which are shared with farmers and funding agencies. 
The code in CO2SYS_Analysis.R is used for the carbonate system chemistry that I conducted as a part of my fellowship. It contains a few approaches to calculate carbonate chemistry
as well as CO2 flux, however the CO2 flux is partially calcuated in Matlab so at present there is a lot of swapping between R and Matlab during these analyses. I am hoping to convert 
some of these matlab scripts into R so they can be used in R as well so we do not have to switch programming languages, and to make an accessible package for future use. 


I am still an undergrad and not a programmer, so any feedback is welcome to make my work more efficient and accurate! 

I am reachable at ijacobs@bu.edu for any questions or comments.
